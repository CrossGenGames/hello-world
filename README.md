Tutorial for introduction to GitHub.
I am currently working on a game a week challenge and during one of my tutorial videos I was watching with Seth Coster from Butterscotch Shenanigans I noticed him "committing" portions of his code to Github from Game Maker Studio 2 and I researched if that was something I should be doing.  Thats the quick version of how I ended up here.  Its a rabbit hole of learning right now.  

I love to eat pizza, make games, play games, hang with family, and learn about Jesus.
